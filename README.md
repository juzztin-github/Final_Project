Academic Project for Bachelor of Technology


Vision-Based Multimodal Deepfake Detection Using Explainable AI
This project detects deepfake images and videos using a multimodal deep learning model combining EfficientNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and BiLSTM architectures.
It also provides explainability using Grad-CAM and SHAP to interpret model predictions.
